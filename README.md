# Google 5-Day Intensive AI Agents — Hands-On Code

This repository contains the hands-on implementations I created while participating in Google’s 5-Day Intensive AI Agents Course. The program is taught by Google’s ML researchers and engineers, and it covers the foundations and practical applications of agentic systems.

The course focuses on:
- Models  
- Tools  
- Orchestration  
- Memory  
- Evaluation  

The goal is to understand how to go beyond simple LLM prototypes and build production-ready AI agents.  
All exercises and code samples are organized by **Day 1 through Day 5** for clarity and progression.

Each day folder contains the code I wrote based on the concepts taught during that module, including experiments, agent setups, tool integrations, and practical exercises.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How AI agents work behind the scenes  
- How to connect models with tools and memory  
- How orchestration ties agent components together  
- How to evaluate and improve agent performance  
- How to build more reliable, production-focused agent workflows
